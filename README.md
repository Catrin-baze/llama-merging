## About the Competition

The **LLM Merging Competition** challenges participants to develop efficient techniques for merging large language models (LLMs). The goal is to improve the performance and efficiency of LLMs by merging different models, creating a more capable and cost-effective solution for future applications in natural language processing.

## Achievements

- **2nd Place** in the **LLM Merging Competition** at **NeurIPS 2024 Challenge**
- Presented our work in a thematic presentation at the event
